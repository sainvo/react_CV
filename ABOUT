This repo is the WIP version of my future online CV.
It will include the same info as in my traditional CV but sectioned per field of expertise:

Translator | Customer service Rep | Accountant | SW Developer 

These sections will be presented as images that the reader can click, which will open up a new page with information relevant to that professional side of me. Thus, recruiters and other people searching for information about me will have it nicely segmented, not as a single blob. 

This kind of CV page will allow me in the future to showcase my skills better, especially as an emerging developer. I would also like to add a chatbot function to it for fun and not so serious Q&A about me.
